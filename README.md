**A CRUD React-Application boilerplate.**

This boilerplate project gives a "ready to code" frontend application that lets
you easily add forms to edit your data entities.

Basically it's an ascetic app to quickly unleash the powers of **react-jsonschema-form**.

## Getting started
The app structure bootstraps from a configuration which is all you need to get started.

Take a look in ```index.jsx``` where the config is load. By default, the configuration from   
**Sample** folder is load to show its capabilities.

## Adopt a data Entity
**3 Steps** to integrate a data Entity into the application.

- Implement the Data Adapter interface
- Define Schemas (JSON Schema and optionally a UI Schema)
- add configuration entry
